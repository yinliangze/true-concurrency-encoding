This is the benchmark for Macro-Step BMC.
The input models are specified in BIP language, which can be found in the bench directory.

VCS is a tool to extract the micro-step model, the serial step semantics model, and the macro-step model and convert them into SMV format.
To generate these models for all examples in bench directory, using:

$ ./generateSMVs

For example, for the DPU.bip which have 3 properties, it will generate:
the micro-step model: DPU.smv
the serial step semantics model: DPU_StepSemantics.smv
the macro-step models: DPU_Macro_Prop0.smv, DPU_Macro_Prop1.smv, DPU_Macro_Prop2.smv

Then the zigzag algorithm in NuSMV-2.5.4 can be used to perform the bounded model checking. 
The NuSMV has been modified that it invokes the zigzag algorithm if you using the -bmc option. 
For example, to verify the DPU.smv, you should using:

$ ./NuSMV -bmc -bmc_length 200 bench/DPU.smv

all the generated models can be deleted by using:
$ ./cleanBench
